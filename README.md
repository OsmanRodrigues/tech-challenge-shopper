## About
<p>
    A nice web API to manage water and gas consume, powered by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/vision">Gemini AI</a>.
</p>

## Getting Started

Below you'll find instructions about how setting up and use this web API.

### Prerequisites

Here are some packages you need to have installed on your PC:

* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/install) 

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

And you'll need a Gemini API key. If you don't have one, see in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey">this link</a> how to get. Once you have an API key, create a `.env` in this repository root and put it there:

```ts
// .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OsmanRodrigues/tech-challenge-shopper.git
   ```
2. Run with `docker`
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. Run in `dev` mode
   1. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   2. Run 
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build and run
   1. Build
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   2. Run the build
   ```sh

   ```
5. Run tests
   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

## Usage

Here you can access the examples of web API communication and resources consume.

Once the steps taken for installation have been successful, the web API should be available in http://localhost:5000/ - for`dev` and `build` steps OR http://localhost:80/ - for `docker` steps.

There are these resources available:
